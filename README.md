Hi Oscar,
I will add some text about today's dilemma.
We had an issue with the winning condition in the Winner function as to beat ConnectFour, you need to align 4 tiles. 
However, even if the array had the 4 numbers involved, there would be another number that would fail that winning condition.

Due to this, I had been thinking and I revised the winning condition and now it is working.
The problem is that since I had to revise it, there are some segments of the Check fonction that will not work with this new contions.
Will attempt to think of something.

After that, there will be a token issue to solve and I believe it would be polished enough.
